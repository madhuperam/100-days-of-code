# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've written the base code of tribute page in HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts** I already completed the Web Development boot camp course on Udemy, but this is the first time I am creating a website completely on my own. Feels great to start the challenge.
